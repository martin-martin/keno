	      <h1>Keno Don Rosa</h1>
	      <h4>My favorite Comic author</h4>
	      <p>His stories brought <strong>adventure, science, history and humor</strong> into my childhood.</p>
	      <p>Only later I realized that he achieved the feat of turning <em>Scrooge McDuck</em>, who with Carl Barks was an utterly non-likeable character, into a character that I wouldn't mind calling an idol.</p>
	      <p>Don Rosa's <em>Scrooge McDuck</em> is an adventurer, a world-traveller, who is tough and self-sustained. He follows opportunity and enjoys competition, but he doesn't exploit others. He works hard and steady to build his fortune. However what really drives him is curiosity and adventure. He lives and breathes getting to know foreign cultures and uncovering ancient mysteries. He is also a hopeless romantic, and most of all: (almost always) true to himself.</p>
	      <p>I like to believe that, as with most good art, there is a lot of the artist's personality in his or her creation. I think that Keno Don Rosa modeled <em>Scrooge McDuck</em>, maybe not even consciously, after himself. :)</p>
	      <p>Do check out some of his work! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Scrooge_McDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a> is maybe his most famous collection of stories, but I'd simply recommend you to check out any of his stories. Nearly all of them are good and allow you to appreciate both Don Rosa's strong storylines filled with wonder and adventure, as well as the seemingly coincidental humor (that is really carefully planned), that seeps through every panel in the form of detailed background drawings. Seems I'm a fan. :)</p>
